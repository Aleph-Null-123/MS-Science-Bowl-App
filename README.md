# MS-Science-Bowl-App

- An app that trains a user for the National Science bowl by presenting questions (provided by NSB) in quiz app form. Questions can be found at https://science.osti.gov/wdts/nsb/Regional-Competitions/Resources/MS-Sample-Questions

This is a personal project of mine (@Aleph-Null-123) that is still partially under development. All credit for the questions featured on the app goes to [National Science Bowl](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/nsb). Currently working on including more questions to be accessed from a cloud database which can be frequented.
